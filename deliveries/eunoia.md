**Context** (optional)
> Please provide a short paragraph or two connecting the deliverables in this milestone and describing their purpose.

Milestone 2 focuses on developing and deploying the Compass AI agent along with the backend APIs that support it. The AI model matches donors with charities in real time, providing personalized recommendations based on donor values and the impact of each cause. The backend APIs integrate this AI functionality with the web application, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend, database, and AI engine.

Together, these deliverables enable the platform to offer intelligent, automated cause-matching, which is central to Eunoiaâ€™s mission of transparent and effective giving. Completing this milestone transforms the platform from a static donation interface into a dynamic, AI-powered experience that improves user engagement and helps onboard both charities and donors.

**Deliverables**
> Please provide a list of all deliverables of the milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.
> 
> Remember that milestone payments are capped at $5,000 USD and must be delivered within 3 months of approval.
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.

We faced significant barriers during Milestone 1 due to the migration to ink! v6, which is still in its alpha stage. This made troubleshooting and contract development difficult, and the delayed response times from the support team (often 1â€“3 days) slowed progress further.

To keep momentum, we focused on completing Milestone 2 first, as our team had been working on all three milestones in parallel. With this PR, we are providing the updates and delivery for Milestone 2, while also hoping to receive any support that could help us accelerate Milestone 1.

Looking ahead to Milestone 3, weâ€™ve secured a letter of interest from one of the largest charities in Ontario, along with interest from other organizations, and are actively working on onboarding them onto the Eunoia platform.
